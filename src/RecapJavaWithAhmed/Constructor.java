    /*
    1-What is constructor and what do you do with it?(what is the purpose of it)

    *Constructor is a way to initialize the instance variables.
    **Assign the values directly to the objects features.

    2-Can you tell me the difference between constructor amd method?

    Constructor:                             Method:
    1-Doesn't have return type            1-Must have return type
    2-Must have same name of the class    2-May or May not same name of class

    3-Can you make constructor static,private or final?

   You CANNOT make the constructor static or final.But As you know I am a special tester that
   use different ways to improve my framework(project).That's why I CAN MAKE the constructor PRIVATE
   By using SINGELTON PATTERN DESIGN In my automation.

   Why:are you making your constructor private in your Singelton:
   -->I make my constructor private because I do not want anyone to initialize my driver
   from that class

    4-What is the difference between THIS,THIS(),SUPER,SUPER()?

   this--> this refers to initialize variable and METHODS
   this()--> this() refers to constructor from the same class**IT MUST BE ON THE FIRST LINE OF CODE
   super-->refers to parent instance variables and methods();
   super()-->refers to parent constructorn**IT MUST BE ON FIRST LINE OF CODE
