    POSSIBLE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:

    1-Can you tell me about map and how do you use map in your project?

     *Map is an awesome interface that I used in my project to store my data as KEY-VALUE
     pairs.

    2-What is the connection between Map and Collection?

    *They are all useful for the project for different purposes.
     *As I mentioned before set is all about uniqueness,list is all about duplication
     and efficiency. Map is all about key-value pairs.
      SHOW OFF NOTES:Hey Madam/Sir AS YOU KNOW, Key part of the map must be UNIQUE
                                              ,Value part can be Duplicates
       *****So based on this, i can say MAP IS A COMBINATION OF LIST AND SET *******
       LIST-->REFERS TO VALUE ****** SET -->REFERS TO KEY******

    3-What is the type of Maps and difference between them
    ORDERS BASED ON KEYS -->ahmet=2,mehmet=3,burak=6;
        -->HashMap-->it stores the element no order(randomly)
        -->LinkHashMap-->it stores the element insertion order(the way that you assign)
        -->TreeMap-->it stores the element ascending order.

    4-What is synchronization? can you give an example ?

    *synchronization-->it executes  any actions one by one.(one after another)
       -->we have two most common synchronized concept -->HASHTABLE, -->STRING BUFFER
       **synchronized system is ***THREAD-SAFE*** and ***SLOW***
       non-synchronized system is ***NOT THREAD-SAFE *** but it is ***FAST***
       *GREAT EXAMPLE FOR NON-synchronized is MAP

     *///NOT THREAD-SAFE -->FAST
     /*
     String[] fruits={"Apple","Banana","Peach","Apple","Orange","Strawberry","Banana",
     "Apple","Cherry","Orange"

     TASK:I want you get the output of total items
        OUTPUT: Apple=3,Banana=2,Peach=1,Orange=2,Strawberry=1

        TIP:You can consider a method of containsKey from map.
