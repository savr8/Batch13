    3-What is overloading and overriding?

   1-OVERLOADING:
   *)Must have different method signature(reference name + parametrs)
   *Overloading must have in same class
   *Overloading methods can have final,static,private(it means reTurn type and access modifiers can be different)

   2-OVERRIDING:
   *)Should have the same signature name but different implementation
   *OVERRIDING should be in different class and mostly they are connected with EXTEND KEY WORD
   *You can not override static,final,private methods.
   SPECIAL NOTE:To be able to override we generally use ABSTRACT AND INTERFACE.(WITH EXTEND KEYWORD)
        You can override from   OBJECT class(toString,Finalize)3
