    1-What is object?and tell me about a few method of it?

   Object is a presentation of the class(blueprint)
   There are many methods of the object but we focus on these:
   -->equals-->which is comparison
   -->toString -->it shows all the variables in a string from+-
   -->Hashcode==>location of the element(object)

    2-What is difference between object and class?

   Object and Class:
   Class==>is a blue-print/templates which you can create as many objects as you like
   Object ==>is a member of instance of a class
   Class==> one can have one scenario
   Object==>You can create as many as you want
   Class==>is declaired with CLASS keyword-->parent
   Object==>is the all child of the class

    3- how do you initialise the instance variables?
    -->There are different ways to initialise the instance variables:
    -->Constructor
    -->Methods(getters and setters)
    -->directly assign the value(by pass value)
    -->With Object(create and object and call it)

    4-What is the difference between instance and local variables?

    Instance variables:                     Local variables:
    ->belong to the class              ->belong to the block of code(method)
